- In my opinion we wouldn't need to sort the whole
list, in order. We just have to make sure we get 
the first 10 places correct.

Algorithm:

- Gather all of the information
- Search for the highest number then place this in the 0 index.
- Increment the index by 1 then search for the next highest number.
- Repeat this 10 times until the first 10 places in the array
contain the 10 winning pigs ordered by weight.

--With this you're making 490 less passes. Before it'd sort
all of them wasting a whole lot of time doing something that's
not needed.
