/* --- main.cpp-----------------------------------------------------------------
    This program reads the contents of file that contains a library of articles 
    from the journal "Communications of the ACM" and places each one into a node
    of a linked list in alphabetical order by their key values. Each article 
    contains three pieces of data: its key, author, and title. The reading and 
    storing of this information is done at the program's start; once these 
    actions have been completed successfully, the user is informed by a welcome 
    message. The user is then presented with a menu of options. This menu will 
    continue to display (even after the user enters and exits a menu option) 
    until the user indicates that he/she wishes to exit the program by using 
    option 'E'.
        Option 'F' allows the user to search the list by typing in the access 
    key of an article. If there is a match in the list, it will be displayed to 
    the user.  Otherwise, the program will inform the user that no matches were 
    found.
        Option 'L' displays the whole list of articles to the user in a very 
    neat and orderly manner.
        Option 'A' allows the user to add a new article to the list. Upon 
    choosing this option, the user will be prompted to enter a key for his or 
    her new article.  If this key exists, the program will inform the user of 
    this conflict and prompt the user for a different key. This will continue 
    until the user enters a valid, non-existent key. Once a valid key is entered, 
    the program will prompt the user for the author's name and the article's 
    title. It will then insert the new article into the list, display a message 
    confirming the insertion, and display the data that was just inserted.
        Option 'R' allows the user to remove an article from the list. Upon 
    choosing this option, the user will be prompted to enter a key for the 
    article that is to be removed. If this key does not exists, the program will 
    inform the user of this and return to the main menu. Otherwise, it will 
    delete the indicated article, and display a message confirming this deletion 
    along with the key of the deleted article.
